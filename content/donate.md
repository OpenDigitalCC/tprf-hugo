Perl is part of the technology stack running many of
today’s businesses. Our donors and sponsors use Perl and
Raku to power their businesses. That’s one reason they
contribute back to our community. But there is so much
more that sponsorship can bring to the community.

- TPF holds [conferences](https://www.perlfoundation.org/events.html)
  that bring together the Perl and Raku community. Speakers give
  technical talks and the community gets together to discuss
  approaches to solving the latest technical problems.
- TPF provides [grants](grants.html) directly in support of projects
  that benefit Perl and Raku users.
- TPF will take new steps to reach out to the community, training new
  programmers in Perl. It will create an online beginner video
  training course and provide beginner training scholarships.
- [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/): This internship program
  supports diversity in free and open source software. TPF sponsors
  this both financially and by providing the interns with a mentor.
- We provide a [job posting website ](https://jobs.perl.org/)where
  employers can share information about their open positions.
- Support for [CPAN](https://cpan.org/) and
  [MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/).
- TPF hosts events across the world to encourage the formation of new
  local groups as well as re-invigorate existing groups.
- Through online efforts and open-source conferences, TPF will
  continue to advocate Perl and Raku to the world.
