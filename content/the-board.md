The board of directors is the decision making body of
the Foundation. It meets once per month and convenes for
additional meetings when required. The board also engages
with the committees and communities every month to encourage
peer support and offer assistance and guidance.

The board is self-electing, and usually draws its
candidates from active volunteers. It is led by the
President who is appointed by the board and is typically
an existing board member. The Treasurer manages
financial operations.

Board members are asked to serve a two-year
term which is renewed if required. They are expected to
attend the monthly board meeting usually held on the third
Friday of the month, be available for general communications
by email and messages as well as attend the monthly
community representatives meeting.

Board members

Stuart Mackintosh, President

Based in Europe, Stuart has been working with
free and open source software since the
mid-1990s. Many of his early projects were
based on Perl and delivering e-commerce, ISP
and communications services.

He
founded various organisations such as Open
Source business integrator OpusVL and industry
association OpenUK.

When Stuart
began using Perl at the start of his on-line
career in the mid 90’s - he found he could
pick it up and use with less overhead than the
alternatives.

Stuart joined the
Foundation because he is grateful that Perl
enabled him to solve many business data
challenges. “I think it is important for
anyone who has built a career in digital
technology to find ways to give back to the
communities that enabled them, either
financially, or by sharing experience and
time.”

He believes non-technical
roles, such as legal, marketing and community
support, are important to help the Perl and
Raku communities.

The President of the Foundation is free to
choose their focus for activity in their
role: the first President concentrated on
conferences and on incorporating TPF as a
non-profit foundation; the previous
President focused on stability. In his role
as President, Stuart is keen to develop
committees and engagement with the Perl and
Raku communities, as well as sponsors and
other foundations.
