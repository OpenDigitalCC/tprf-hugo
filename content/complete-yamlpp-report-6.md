Complete YAML::PP Report #6By Mark A Jensen
March 6, 2018

Tinita spent about 20 hours coding [YAML::PP](complete-yamlpp.html) this month.
To her growing YAML bibliography, she has
added ["Strings in YAML - To Quote or not to Quote"](http://blogs.perl.org/users/tinita/2018/03/strings-in-yaml---to-quote-or-not-to-quote.html). Here Tina shows very clearly that Ingy's ultimate
goal was to write the Kobiyashi Maru of format
specifications. (She doesn't say that.)
In ["Safely load untrusted YAML in Perl"](http://blogs.perl.org/users/tinita/2018/02/safely-load-untrusted-yaml-in-perl.html), she compares multiple parsers with respect to object
loading and cyclic reference handling.
She also continued to hack away on YAML::PP. You can
read about that in her [latest report](http://blogs.perl.org/users/tinita/2018/03/yamlpp-grant-report-february-2018.html).
