### ARTICLE IX

No
member of the board of directors of the corporation who is a
volunteer director, as that term is defined in the Michigan

liable to this corporation for monetary damages for a breach
of the director's fiduciary duty; provided, however, that
this provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of
a director for any of the following:

1. a breach
   of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation;
2. acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve
   intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
3. a violation of section 551(1) of the Act;
4. a
   transaction from which the director derived an improper
   personal benefit;
5. an act or omission occurring
   before the filing of these articles of incorporation; or

The
corporation assumes all liability to any person, other than
the corporation, for all acts or omissions of a director who
is a volunteer director, as defined in the Act, incurred in
the good faith performance of the director's duties.
However, the corporation shall not be considered to have
assumed any liability to the extent that such assumption is
inconsistent with the status of the corporation as an
organization described in IRC 501(c)(3) or the corresponding
section of any future federal tax code.

If the
Act is amended after the filing of these articles of
incorporation to authorize the further elimination or
limitation of the liability of directors of nonprofit
corporations, then the liability of members of the board of
directors, in addition to that described in Article IX,
shall be assumed by the corporation or eliminated or limited
to the fullest extent permitted by the Act as so amended.
Such an elimination, limitation, or assumption of liability
is not effective to the extent that it is inconsistent with
the status of the corporation as an organization described
in IRC 501(c)(3) or corresponding section of any future
federal tax code. No amendment or repeal of Article IX shall
apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged
liability of any member of the board of directors of this
corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions
occurring before the effective date of any such amendment or
repeal.

   or reasonably believed he or she was acting within the scope
   of his or her authority.
2. The volunteer was acting in
   good faith.
3. The volunteer's conduct did not amount
   to gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct.
4. The volunteer's conduct was not an intentional tort.

   ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle for which
   tort liability may be imposed as provided in section 3135 of
   the Insurance Code of 1956, Act No. 218 of the Public Acts
   of 1956, being section 500.3135 of the Michigan Compiled
