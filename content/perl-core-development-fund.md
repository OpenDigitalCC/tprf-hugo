In 2008 a generous contribution from Booking.com enabled
The Perl Foundation to provide a series of grants, awarded
to Dave Mitchell, targeted at improving the Perl 5 core.
This project has been very successful and once the
original contribution was spent we committed to raising
new funding to help continue and expand this important
venture. It was named as Perl 5 Core Maintenance Fund.

In
2020 The Perl Foundation announced closure of the Perl 5
Core Maintenance Fund and launch of the Perl Core
Development Fund. Details of the funding raised so far and
how this has been spent will be published in
[a public accessible location](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BVas4wi-q0uHc59BBW5A6T0fBQtkpqvDzoDOMoTxFRQ/edit#gid=0)
for the both funds.

Description of Fund
The donations made to this fund will be used for the
development and improvement of the Perl core. Funds will
be disbursed via grants awarded by the Grants Committee in
conjunction with well-respected members of the Perl
community. The grants will be awarded to the most
appropriate applicant and managed in association with the
Perl Core Team.

Applicant Eligibility
Due to the nature of this fund, and its targeted focus,
eligibility to apply has two initial requirements:

The applicant must be a contributor to the Perl
core.

The application must be endorsed by one or more
people with commit rights to the Perl core.

### Approval Process

Once an application has been received, and confirmed as
matching the initial requirements, it will be published on
The Perl Foundation News site for a period of community
feedback. If it is required, by the nature of the grant,
feedback may also be requested from key community members.
During this period of feedback applicants may be asked to
provide additional material or to amend their application
before it is put forward for evaluation.
Final evaluation of any grants will be performed by the
Grants Committee in consultation with other members
(Executive, Board and Committee); with members of the Perl
Steering Council.

### License and Release

Any code created, modified or submitted during the period
of the grant must be released as open source under the
same license terms as Perl itself. Completed work must be
published in a public version control system. Release
notes should include an acknowledgment that work was
funded by The Perl Foundation’s Perl Core Development
Fund.

Reporting

Successful applicants must provide a monthly report to
the Perl Porters mailing list and The Perl Foundation News
site. Missing two reports in a row without prior notice
will result in immediate suspension of the grant until the
Grants Committee has determined if the grant will be
permitted to continue.

### Management

Each grant will have at least one manager to
represent the Perl Core Team and one manager to
represent the Grants Committee. A grant manager may
not fill both roles simultaneously.

In cases where the applicant does not have a commit
bit to the Perl core, the manager from Perl Core Team
must be an existing committer.

Payments will be made on a monthly basis, in arrears,
only after the work has been signed off and the
monthly report has been published to The Perl
Foundation News Site by the grant manager.

In the case of a dispute that cannot be resolved the
grant will be terminated.

### Termination of Grant

As previously stated, missing two reports in a row
without prior notice will suspend the grant. Payment will
be made for the work completed to date. For time based
grants, payment will be for hours worked. For milestone
based grants, payment will be made up to the last
completed milestone.

Management of Fund

### Administration Costs

The administration costs of running the fund, including
the wire transfer fees, will be taken from the
fund.

### Review

The structure of this fund may be amended at the
discretion of the The Perl Foundation Board, in
consultation with the Perl core team. Any changes made to
the fund would not apply to grants already running, unless
the Grants Committee and the grantee agree to such a
change.

### Termination

If a period of one year has elapsed with no grants in
progress and no new applications, the remaining funds will
be transferred to The Perl Foundation’s general
fund.
