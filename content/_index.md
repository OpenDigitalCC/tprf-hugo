The Perl Foundation accepts donations from organizations
that depend on Perl or Raku, and from individuals who love
programming with the Perl or Raku languages. Our desire
is to build a strong, healthy and sustainable language
ecosystem and community.

If you use Perl or Raku
to support your business, or as a hobby, your donation will
help fund projects and events that support continued
development.

Grants

Our grant programs help fund development of open source
projects to benefit Perl, Raku and the broader Community.
These grants are funded by donations and help support open
source developers.

Events

Open source development is driven by in-person events where
developers share ideas, code, and have fun.

The
Foundation helps to sponsor many events, worldwide, each
year. Take a look at the schedule and join us at an event
