Test2 Manual: Report #1By

[Alberto Simoes](http://blogs.perl.org/users/alberto_simoes/)

June 30, 2016

Chad Granum just completed his first Test2 grant, and
took some time for rest and payment bureaucracy before
starting his second grant, now documenting Test 2.

This
is the first report for this new grant. During the last
weeks he worked in an initial Test2 tutorial, that was
incorporated into his YAPC presentation available at
https://test-more.github.io/Test2-Manual/#tutorial.
Accordingly with his report, this is just the beginning on
how to write tests. Soon he will also start the sections
for Test Tool authors.
