Test2 Manual: Report #2

By [Alberto Simoes](http://blogs.perl.org/users/alberto_simoes/)

August 2, 2016

Chad has been working
slowly on his grant given some personal issues.
Nevertheless, there is some progress on Test2-Manual,
namely some formatting issues. You can peek Chad work on
his GitHub repository, [https://github.com/Test-More/Test2-Manual](https://github.com/Test-More/Test2-Manual). Be sure to look both to the master and gh-pages
branches, as neither gives a complete view of Chad plans
in isolation.
