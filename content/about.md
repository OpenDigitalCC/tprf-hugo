---

The Perl Foundation is dedicated to the advancement of the Perl and Raku
programming language. We seek to do this through open discussion,
collaboration, design, and code.

The Foundation also coordinates the efforts of numerous grass-roots Perl-based
groups and organisations. These include [The Perl
Conference](https://perlconference.us/).

We also carry the legal responsibility
for [Perl 5](http://www.perl.org/get.html), [Raku](http://dev.perl.org/perl6/), [perl.org](http://www.perl.org/), [Perl Mongers](http://www.pm.org/), and [PerlMonks](http://www.perlmonks.org/).
