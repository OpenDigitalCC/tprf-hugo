TPRF Advisory Board

The TPRF Advisory Board is for people who want
to be connected to The Perl Foundation in a
non-executive, non-operational and
non-technical capacity, where the board can
draw on knowledge and experience, and seek
support where needed.

Members are
invited by the board and may include retired
board members or specific key members of the
wider community.

What is the role of the Advisory Board?

The role of the Advisory Board is to support
TPRF Board in a non-voting capacity. The aim
is to have access to tacit knowledge and
experience. Apart from general dialogue
between the members, TPF Board and communities
only expect occasional support from the
Advisory Board.

Who can sit on the Advisory Board?

Members of the Advisory Board are selected by
TPRF Board. Those invited to join include
former Board or Committee members, or external
people who could offer significant value by
joining the board.

Current
members of the Board may also participate in
the Advisory Board communications.

How are members invited?

Invitation letters are sent electronically by
TPRF President. There is no automatic
membership of the Advisory Board. It is
strictly by invitation only.

Who is on the Advisory Board?

-   Allison Randal
-   Dan Wright
-   Nat Torkington

How does one leave the Advisory Board?

A member can give notice at any time or may be
asked to leave by the sitting TPRF
president.

How do members
communicate?
A low-volume mailing list is
set up for members to communicate with each
other and between TPF Board liaison and the
Advisory Board.

Who is Chair of the Advisory Board?

The position of Chair and liaison with TPRF
Board is held by the sitting TPRF president
who will keep the communications open.

What is expected of a member of the Advisory
Board?

Members provide help and assistance to our
organization where possible for future and
historical issues. TPRF Board may occasionally
invite Advisory Board members to join board
meetings.

All members of the
Advisory Board are expected to be exemplars of
professional behavior and role models for our
community.

Advisory Board
members will be listed on TPRF website along
with a one-line bio and photo. They will be
subscribed to the Advisory Board low traffic
email list.
