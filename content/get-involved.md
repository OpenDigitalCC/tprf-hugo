## Want to Help?

The Perl & Raku Foundation exists to promote and
support community efforts around the Perl and Raku
programming languages. We encourage you to contribute
by:

-   Joining your local [Perl Mongers](http://www.pm.org/) group
-   Visit [PerlMonks](http://perlmonks.org/)
-   Attend a [YAPC](http://www.yapc.org/) in your region of the world
-   There are many other ways you can contribute to Perl and
    Raku including:
    -   Contribute and maintain a module on the CPAN
    -   Participate in the development, maintenance and documentation of
        Perl 5 and Raku.
    -   Another important way you can contribute to Perl, both as a
        language and as a community, is to make a tax-deductible
        [donation to the Perl Foundation](donate.html).
