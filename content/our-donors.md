The Perl Foundation extends our sincere thanks to all our sponsors, large and
small. If you would like to make a donation, [visit our donation
page](donate.html).

Our donors use Perl or Raku to power their businesses and that's one reason
they contribute back to the community. In addition to supporting Perl with
donations, these companies are great options for programmers looking for good
jobs at companies that use Perl extensively.

We are also very grateful to our [past sponsors](past-sponsors.html).
