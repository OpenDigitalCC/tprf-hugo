The purpose of this policy is to protect The Perl
Foundation's interests when it is considering entering into
a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private
interest of an officer or director of the foundation. This
policy does not replace any applicable state and federal
laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit
and charitable organizations

No member of the
Board of Directors shall participate in any discussion or
vote on any matter in which the director or a member of
their immediate family has potential conflict of interest
due to having material economic involvement regarding the
matter being discussed.

When such a situation
presents itself, the director must announce their potential
conflict, disqualify themselves, and be excused from the
meeting until discussion is over on the matter involved. A
recused member may not vote on a motion related to this
situation. The chair of the meeting is expected to make
inquiry if such a conflict appears to exist and the board
member has not made it known.

Adopted by the Board of Directors on 2021-03-01.
