Contributor License AgreementThis non-exclusive license is designed to serve the Perl
community, including contributors to projects of the Perl
Foundation ("Foundation"), the open source projects and
products the Foundation supports, and the users of these
projects and products. In order to document the
non-exclusive intellectual property license granted for
contributions to the projects, the Foundation obtains a
Contributor License Agreement ("CLA"), signed by each
Contributor. Under the CLA the contributor retains ownership
of each Contribution, and remains free to use each
contribution independently of the Foundation for other
purposes.

signed CLA to:

Yet Another Society d/b/a The Perl Foundation

1. Definitions.

The
"Work" means an existing body of code or documentation that
is part of any of the projects or products owned or managed
by the Foundation.

"Contribution" means any work
of authorship, including any modifications or additions to
the Work, that is Submitted by you for inclusion in the
Work.

"Submitted" means provided to the project,
or its representatives, by any form of electronic, verbal,
or written communication, for instance, posting to
electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, or
issue tracking systems that are used for building,
discussing, and improving the Work. No communication that is
conspicuously marked in writing by you as "Not a
Contribution" will be considered to be a Contribution.

"Users"
means recipients of the Work distributed by the Foundation,
or distributed by others in accordance with the Foundation's
requirements.

"You" means the individual, or
other party, that is making this CLA with the Foundation.
For parties other than individuals, "you" includes all of
the organizational affiliates of the party signing this CLA.
An "organizational affiliate" means each party that
controls, is controlled by, or under common control with,
the party signing this CLA.

2. Acceptance. You
accept and agree to the terms and conditions of this CLA for
your present and future Contributions, and for your
Contributions made prior to signing this CLA. Your prior
contributions subject to this CLA include, but are not
limited to, the Contributions listed on Schedule 1.

3.
Foundation Obligations. In return for the license granted
under this CLA, the Foundation will use your Contributions
only in ways that are consistent with the open source nature
of the Work. Except for the license granted under this CLA,
you reserve all rights in your Contributions.

4.
License.

4.1 Subject to this CLA, you grant to
the Foundation, and to the Users, a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, free-of-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
license under all intellectual property rights (excluding
patent and trademark, but including copyright) to reproduce,
prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions, and
derivative works.

4.2 You also grant to the
Foundation, and to the Users, a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, free-of-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as specified in this section) patent license to
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
otherwise transfer the Contribution. This license applies
only to those patent claims licensable by you (including
without limitation any patent claims you may acquire in the
future) that are necessarily infringed by your
Contribution(s) alone, or by the combination of your
Contribution(s) with the Work or with the subsequent
contributions of anyone else. If any party institutes patent
litigation against you or any other party (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your
Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed,
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
any patent licenses granted to that party based on the
rights you have granted to the Foundation under this CLA
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

5.
Representations.

5.1 You represent that you are
legally entitled to grant this license. If your employer(s)
has rights to intellectual property created by you which
include your Contributions, you represent that you have
received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that
employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for
your Contributions to the Foundation, or that your employer
has signed a separate CLA with the Foundation. If you have
employees, you also represent that any employee making a
Contribution on your behalf is fully authorized to do so,
and that you have sufficient rights in the employee's
Contribution to grant this license.

5.2 You also
represent that each of your Contributions is your original
creation, and that to the best of your knowledge, includes
complete details of any third-party license or other
restriction, for instance, related patents and trademarks
associated with it.

5.3 If you become aware of
any facts or circumstances that would make your
representation under this CLA inaccurate in any respect, you
will notify the Foundation promptly.

6. Support.
You are not expected to provide support for your
Contributions, unless you want to do so. Whether or not you
charge a fee for support is up to you.

7.
Warranty Disclaimer. To the extent permitted by law, you
provide your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
