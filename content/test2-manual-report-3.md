Test2 Manual: Report #3

By [Alberto Simones](http://blogs.perl.org/users/alberto_simoes/)

In the last two months, Chad Granum has been working on
his grant. The latest news are described below:
-   started to write about bundles, and realized there was a major
    shortcoming, so he has been improving Importer.pm to make writing
    bundles easier.
-   wrote additional documentation for writing comparison objects for
    Test2::Compare, that will also present in the manual.
-   Test2::Manual::EndToEnd was finished, in the sense that it includes
    everything Chad planned. It still needs some editing for grammar and
    errors correction, and probably some enhancements. But it is mostly
    complete, and comprises the most useful part for anyone who wants to
    work with Test2.
