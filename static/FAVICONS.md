Please refer to the Hugo [Blowfish theme
documentation](https://blowfish.page/docs/partials/#favicons) about how to customize
the favicons.

Favicons can be regenerated from a [hi-definition Perl-Assets SVG
camel](https://github.com/metacpan/perl-assets/). It's recommended to upload the
source file to [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/), download the
archive and unzip in the Hugo `static/` directory. It's usually not something that's
automated.
